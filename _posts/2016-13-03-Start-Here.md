![Starting a Small Business Website]({{site.url}}/images/website-design.jpg "Starting A Small Business Website")

In keeping with my goal of **Helping Small Businesses Navigate the Internet** this first post will explain the main parts required to get your small business online. There are many ways of doing this, but I want to show how you can do it yourself at a low cost while still preserving the professional appearance and functionality your business needs to stand out from the competition as well as rank well with the search engines.

The clients I worked with were often just starting their business and did not have the budget for an expensive website. The recommendations and steps I will show you may look intimidating at first. This is not going to be a *20 minute - click a few buttons* instant online website promo that you may have seen on TV. Those do not provide the professional results you want.

As dangerous as that may be, I am going to make several assumptions about you, the small business owner, as we go forward.

* You need a simple website to showcase the services you provide locally.
* You have some computer skills. Or have someone in your family or business who does.
* You do not have thousands of dollars to pay a web design firm.

These three assumptions are very important. Let me explain. We will build a website to showcase services, not sell products online. These are two completely different things. Selling products online requires far more functionality including collecting payments. In future posts I will show you how to add that functionality to your website, but for now, we are going to put together an "Online Brochure" so that potential customers can find you, learn about you, and contact you.

I am assuming that you are comfortable working on computers. If you struggle sending an email, this may not be the thing for you. I will break things down to their simplest form, and each article has a comment section where you can ask questions.

I am always looking for free or low cost [services][services] and [tools][tools] on the Internet. We will use many of these to build your website. To give you an idea of the costs, here is what this website cost to build and maintain:

| ------------- |:-------------:|:--------:|
| Domain Name   | $12			| Annually |
| Template     	| $26      		| One time |
| Email 		| $2		    | Monthly  |
| Hosting 		| $1		    | Monthly  |

That is a one time cost of $26 and then $4 dollars a month to keep it going. And this is hosted at Amazon, a very robust secure enterprise grade hosting service. Not at a slow shared server farm like GoDaddy. My costs will go up as I get more traffic, but I am OK with that.

I will say that the major cost of web development is the labor. I put many long hours into this project. Developers can charge $50 an hour or more. But if you are willing to put in the labor, you will save thousands of dollars.

After we are done getting the basic web site and email set up, I will post articles where you can learn how to add more functionality to your website. Even if you do not end up doing the work yourself, these articles will give you a better understanding of the basics so when your developer makes recommendations you will understand the level of work and associated costs that go with it. If you do hire a developer, please heed my advice about [domain names][domainname].

### The Basic Parts Needed to get Online

The minimum components you need to establish your web presence are:

* [Domain Name][domainname] - your address on the Internet, for example `google.com`.
* Hosting - a system of web services that serves your website out to the Internet.
* Content - all the layout and text that people see when they visit your website.
* Email - not to be overlooked, you need a professional email address.

The details of each are covered in a separate article, But in general, your content includes all the formatting, images, and words your customers will see. All this is uploaded to your account at a hosting company of your choice. When a customer types your domain name into a browser, or more likely, finds your business using a search engine, they are directed to your account at the hosting company and see your content displayed on their computer or mobile device. This happens in a fraction of a second. 

Email is also dependent on your domain name, but is handled very differently. I will show you how to setup a basic email account and provide tips on using it effectively.

I recommend you start with the [domain name][domainname] article, then hosting, content, and finally email. But it's your choice.
