![Develop you Website Content]({{site.url}}/images/web-design.jpg "Develop you Website Content")

Creating the web pages that make up your website can be very time consuming. Creating a website from scratch takes creative skill and knowledge of HTML, CSS, and javascript. This is the part that can cost thousands of dollars if you pay a web design firm to do it for you.  But we will not create one from scratch, we will use a professionally built template that already has the colors, layout and code done for you. You will replace the images and text to make it yours. This post will guide you through the steps of a template selection and how to modify it to meet your needs.
