![Starting a Small Business Website]({{site.url}}/images/website-design.jpg "Starting A Small Business Website")

In keeping with my goal of Helping Small Businesses Navigate the Internet this **quick start to building a static website** will list the steps required to get your small business online. There are many ways of doing this, but I want to show how you can do it yourself at a low cost while still preserving the professional appearance and functionality your business needs to stand out from the competition as well as rank well with the search engines.

Although this article says it is a quick start, this not a *20 minute - click a few buttons* instant online website promo that you may have seen on TV. Those do not provide the professional results you want. Be prepared to spend some time putting this together, however, you can build a professional website for under $30 and maintain it for under $5 a month.

As risky as that may be, I am going to make several assumptions about you, the small business owner, as we go forward.

* You only need a simple website to showcase the services you provide.
* You have average computer skills, or have someone in your family or business who does.
* You do not have thousands of dollars to pay a web developer. 

After we are done getting the basic website and email set up, I will post articles where you can learn how to add more functionality to your website. Even if you do not end up doing the work yourself, these articles will give you a better understanding of the basics so when your developer makes recommendations you will understand the level of work and associated costs that go with it. If you do hire a developer, please heed my advice about [domain names][domainname].

### What You Need to Start

* A computer connected to the Internet. The bigger the screen the better. I prefer Mac, but Windows will do.
* A good text editor. I use [Sublime Text][sublime] but there are many great free ones out there. The important part is that it has syntax highlighting.
* A secure file transfer (SFTP) browser. [Cyberduck][cyberduck] is awesome and free.
* Patience - this will take awhile but you will save thousands.

>Tip: Setup a free [Google account][googleaccount] for your business. You do not have to setup Gmail to have a Google account. You will be using several of their services and you should keep them separate from your personal stuff. Also, get a good password manager. This will save you time and frustration. I use [1Password].

### Steps to Creating your Small Business Online

1. Register your [domain name][domainname] - This is your address on the Internet, for example `lampapps.com`.
2. Sign up for a [hosting] service - This is a system of web services that serves your website out to the Internet. I use Amazon S3.
3. Create your website content - This is all the layout and text that people see when they visit your website. This will be the most time consuming part.
4. Upload you content to your hosting service.
5. Point your domain name to your hosted website content - You will use a Domain Name Service (DNS) to do this.
6. Email - Not to be overlooked, you need a professional email address. Please don't use AOL for your business email.

The details of each are covered in the separate articles, but in general, your uploaded content includes all the formatting, images, and words your customers will see. All this is uploaded to your account at a hosting company of your choice. When a customer types your domain name into a browser, or more likely, finds your business using a search engine like Google, they are directed to your account at the hosting company where they will see your content displayed on their computer or mobile device. This all happens in a fraction of a second. 

Like your website, email is also dependent on your domain name, but is handled very differently. I will show you how to setup an email account and provide tips on using it effectively.

I recommend you start with the [Whats in a Domain Name][domainname] article, then follow the steps listed above. But it's your choice.
