&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-amazon-s3&quot;&gt;What is Amazon S3?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a cloud based storage service with a simple web based management console to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It is very reliable as it is designed to deliver 99.999999999% uptime. It is very secure. It allows you to store large amounts of data at a very low cost. Since your website has very little data, your cost should be negligible. If fact, the first year will be free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And best of all, it can also host static web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-static-website&quot;&gt;What is a Static Website?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simply means it does not depend on any special scripts or databases on the server to work. Many websites require a database to manage the content. These databases then require a script running on the server to allow the web page to dynamically render the web pages each time. This requires additional processing power and extra security to handle. Static web pages can still have animation and functionality. These are handled by the user’s browser instead of the server. You can also use third party resources to plug into the static website. That is how the comments section of this website work. This website is hosted at Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-up-amazon-s3&quot;&gt;Setting up Amazon S3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxrdFPXJMeHru_b4Q_vTPQ&quot;&gt;Savjee&lt;/a&gt; has a very good video tutorial on how to setup Amazon S3 for a static website. Please watch his short tutorial then continue below to step through the process where I will fill in some of the details you will need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/g9NbuTcos18?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;two spacing&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;steps&quot;&gt;Steps&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: I will be using example.com to explain how to set this up. You should substitute your domain name, not example.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you do not have a Amazon Web Service account you will need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/free/&quot;&gt;create one&lt;/a&gt;. They offer a free tier that will be able to use for the first year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Navigate to the S3 management console and create two buckets:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;example.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;www.example.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why two? Because you want to be able to access your website using example.com and www.example.com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload two files to the example.com bucket. We need this to test that it works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tip: If you do not yet know what a html file is you can use this &lt;a href=&quot;/documents/example.txt&quot;&gt;html file&lt;/a&gt;. Cut and paste the text into a file on your computer. Rename it index.html&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Website hosting companies provide services that allow you to get your website published online. This includes the actual servers that host your website, services for sending and receiving email, domain name registration, and other networking requirements to get your website up and running. They do not provide the content for your website nor provide the labor to build and maintain your website. Hosting services come in many different sizes and varieties. Choosing the right hosting company and hosting plan is not easy unless you understand a little about how hosting works and what they are offering. You need a reputable service, but you may not need all the services they are offering. I will explain some of the geek speak, and break down the things you need to know in order to choose a quality hosting company and select the proper hosting plan for your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you will be surprised to learn that you can find quality hosting services at a low cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-do-hosting-companies-provide&quot;&gt;What do Hosting Companies provide?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most run of the mill web hosting companies provide a wide range of services. You will find their basic hosting plans provide many services bundled together such as domain name, web server, scripting language, email, database, backups, etc… You may be tempted to do that but understand that the low prices you are seeing are for shared hosting. You could move up to a Virtual Private Server (VPS), but then you are responsible for the management of that server, or you can to pay an additional cost for someone to manage it for you. But why pay for services you don’t need. I will explain two of the most popular hosting types then give you a third option that I think you will like. We won’t go into dedicated hosting as that is beyond what you will need for a small business website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shared-server&quot;&gt;Shared Server&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of the hosting company as the landlord of a large warehouse. For a few dollars a month the “landlord” lets anyone use the warehouse. You get your own secure locker to put your stuff in and your own mailbox but the warehouse only has one water pipe and one electric meter. The more people using the warehouse the less access to resources each person has. If too many people need water at the same time the pressure drops to a trickle. If the demand for power is too high, the system will overload and shut down. The “landlord” hopes that everyone will use the resources in moderation. But, there are always a few greedy tenants that take far more than their share, resulting in degraded services for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is basically shared hosting. The server is the warehouse. The locker is your account on the server where you store your website content and email. The water is the bandwidth allowing data in and out to the Internet and the electricity is the processing power of the server. This one server shares the database, memory and processor (CPU) with all the websites assigned to it. There are physical limitations to the server. The hope is that most websites will under utilize the server resources and only a few websites will use more than the average, thus never exceeding the server’s limitations. Just remember, the hosting company will maintain the server, but you have to maintain the website content that is in your account on that server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;virtual-private-server-vps&quot;&gt;Virtual Private Server (VPS)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now think of an apartment building. Each small apartment in the building has it’s own separate water and electric meter. You do not have to share these with your neighbors. The landlord supplies all the apartments with the resources up to the set limit agreed upon when you sign up. No one else can weasel in to your resources even if your not using them. VPS servers use a technology called virtualization to setup individual virtual servers on one large physical server. In addition to your website on the VPS, you are responsible to maintain the server or you have to pay more to have someone do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-third-option-for-basic-websites&quot;&gt;A Third Option for Basic Websites&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services. They break down each service that the common hosting companies bundle together. One such service is Simple Storage Service (S3). As its name implies, you can store files in the cloud using this serves. But it can also host static websites. Static just means that the server does not need to process any data, no database, no email, and no code can be run on S3. S3 justs serves simple web pages out to the Internet. Add a few other basic services AWS offers and you are running a full fledge, yet simple website for dollars a month. Best part is that it is professional enterprise level hosting solution. As with the other options, you have to maintain your website content, but Amazon maintains the S3 service. This is the hosting I recommended for your small business website. Since S3 scales automatically with your requirements, there is plans to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hosting-plans&quot;&gt;Hosting Plans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average small business website would not use more than 100 megabytes (MB) of storage space, excluding email. Most companies offer unmetered bandwidth so that is not generally a concern for small websites. Most entry level shared hosting plan can only handle about 10,000 visitors per month before they get overloaded. If you are comparing hosting options, please remember that you should serve your website using a security certificate (SSL) and a Content Delivery Network (CDN). Once you add these in you will find the costs increase. The eye catching prices you see are not what you want. You will also find that email takes far more disk space than the website. Having your email managed by Google’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/landing/partners/referral/trial.html?utm_source=sign-up&amp;amp;utm_medium=referralbutton1&amp;amp;utm_campaign=apps-referral-program&amp;amp;utm_content=%3Chttps://goo.gl/nCwWpT%3E&quot;&gt;G Suite&lt;/a&gt; or other option like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zoho.com/mail/zohomail-pricing2.html&quot;&gt;ZoHo&lt;/a&gt; may be far better than combining it with your website. Why pay for all the bundled services when you don’t need them. Select ala cart from companies that do the best job at the lowest costs. Pay for only what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tip: If you choose to go with one of the common hosting plans, start as small as possible, you can move up if needed. I highly recommend that you choose a company that uses cPanel to manage your web hosting account. cPanel is very common in the industry so if you choose to move from one host to another it makes it very easy. GoDaddy does not use cPanel. But if you want to keep it simple, follow my articles to build a static website at Amazon S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to setup your &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/2016/11/12/Static-Website-Hosting.html&quot;&gt;hosting service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A domain name is your trademark on the Internet. It is the human readable address used to find your website, for example &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;freshapples.com&lt;/code&gt;. It is what you want people to remember and what you want people to find when they search on the Internet. As important as it is, you do not need to spend a lot of money to obtain one. It can be as little as $12 a year. It is easy to register your domain name, but not very easy to choose the right one. This article will describe how they work, how to choose one, and how to register one for your website and email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-a-domain-name&quot;&gt;What is a Domain Name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have heard that an Internet address is just a bunch of numbers. That is essentially true. But humans can’t interpret those easily, so a system was developed to translate the numbers into words that you and I can read and remember easily. You can reach a website by typing into the browser’s address bar the numbers (known as an IP address) or the domain name. For example: &lt;a href=&quot;http://104.43.142.34&quot;&gt;104.43.142.34&lt;/a&gt; will take you to the same website as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com&quot;&gt;microsoft.com&lt;/a&gt;. When you type in the domain name a service called Domain Name System (DNS) translates the name into the number and sends you to the right place. This all takes place in  milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you register a domain name it is yours to keep as long as you keep your registration current. The number is assigned to the hosting provider that owns the server that hosts your website. This allows the domain name owner to change the physical location of their website or email without changing their “trademark” on the Internet. Your email and website can even be at separate hosting services as we will demonstrate later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to understand that there are thousands of people who are willing to take your money to host your site and register your domain name. There is an entire industry of resellers out there (I was one). Some are great, some, not so much. I have personally seen a small business loose their domain name because the developer of their website registered it for them. The developer never told the customer where it was registered or when it would expire. When that developer disappeared, so did the domain name, email and website. Their business was wiped off the Internet in one day. It can be very difficult to get back. It can take weeks and costs hundreds of dollars if it can be done at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your domain name should be registered in your name. Only those you trust should have access to it. It is as important to your business as the keys to the front door of your store. If you control your domain name yourself and your hosting provider disappears, or you decide to change providers, you can reestablish everything at another service in a short time without disruption of your website and email. I prefer to register my domain names with reputable, accredited registrars separate from where my website and email are hosted. I will cover this more below under registering a domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;choosing-a-domain-name&quot;&gt;Choosing a Domain Name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your domain name can be the name of your business like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt; or can describe your business like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;charlestonlocksmith.com&lt;/code&gt;. Either way is fine, but here are some considerations to help you decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your business name available? If it is, grab it quick. Even if you do not use it, no one else can as long as you own it. A domain name registration should not cost you more than $15 per year for a .com, .net , or .org unless the domain you want is considered a “Premium Domain Name” (more on that later). Many businesses register their business name with all three top level domains (.com, .net, and .org) just to protect their trademark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your business name is not available, you could modify it slightly. For example, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tomslandscaping.com&lt;/code&gt; may not be available, but &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tomslandscapingsc.com&lt;/code&gt; is. I added &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sc&lt;/code&gt; to the end for the state of South Carolina. This works if the other Tom’s Landscaping Company is not in the same state. You could also add the city or region as long as it does not make the domain name too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep your domain name short. The easier it is to remember the better. One of the most expensive domain names ever sold cost $10,000,000. It was one word with three letters before the “.com”. Started with an S, ended with a X. Obviously, I will not link to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get fancy with words. For example &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bikes4sale.com&lt;/code&gt;. Unless you own both &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bikesforsale.com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bikes4sale.com&lt;/code&gt; you may send your customers to your competitors website. You can use a dash to separate words within a domain name. For example: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;charleston-locksmith.com&lt;/code&gt; but I recommend against it as it will often get left out when conveying it verbally, such as when sharing your email address. Remember, your domain name is part of your email too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide to buy a domain name that describes your business, use one, two or maybe three key words. Again, the shorter the better. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;charlestonlocksmith.com&lt;/code&gt; is a great example of a domain name for a local locksmith in Charleston. Customers will use those two words to search for that service in Charleston. We want to optimize our website for the search engines. The domain name is part of that. More on search engine optimization, also known as SEO, in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find that most of the great domain names are taken. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;charlestonlocksmith.com&lt;/code&gt; is already registered and, at the time of this writing, is being offered for sale for $599. This is an example of a “Premium Domain Name”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hint: Premium domain names may cost more to obtain, but once you own it, the cost of renewing the registration is only the basic cost of registration. Typically, less than $15 per year for a .com, .net, or .org. The importance of your domain name can not be understated. A premium domain name may pay off in the long run as it will capture more business on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the last year or so, the landscape of domain names has changed. No longer do you have to select a .com, .net, or .org domain name. You can register .lawyer, .consulting, .dentist, and dozens more. More top level domains, as they are called, are being added all the time. The jury is still out on how people will accept these. I talked to one local small business owner who said he purchased one for his business but the bank could not accept it when he applied for a business account, as their system only accepted .com, .net, or .org.  I think this a rare exception and will quickly be fixed. I personally have invested in these new domain names. They may cost a little more money, up to $29 or more annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;registering-a-domain-name&quot;&gt;Registering a Domain Name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I eluded to earlier, where you register your domain name is important. Not only in cost, but in securing your trademark on the Internet. There are several big names in the industry in the United States. I am not a big fan of GoDaddy.com. They are missing some key features that I would expect. The other big name in the industry is Enom. They cater to resellers but their service is full featured and easy to use for anyone. I used their service for my web development company. Google is also in the domain registrar business. Several features that cost extra with other companies are provided for free with Google. These include the ability to hide your personal information from the public. Although they may not have deals or discounts advertised as the others do, their price is fair. A .com domain is just $12 per year. Compare the extras you get for free and I think you come out ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hint: You will probable be using more than one Google service along the way. If you already have a Google Account, then you can sign in and use that. However, you may want to create a new one just for your business keeping your personal email and other documents separate from your business. You will have a chance to do that when you purchase a domain name with Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the process at &lt;a href=&quot;https://domains.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google’s Domain Name Registration page&lt;/a&gt;. There you can search for a new domain name. Once you enter it, you will see something like this image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/googledomain.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Registering a Domain Name with Google&quot; title=&quot;Registering a Domain Name with Google&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The returned results will let you know if the name you want is available or not. If it is, you can place it in your basket and purchase it. If not, you can see suggestions for similar names. See the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Add Extension&lt;/code&gt; link? There you can find all the new top level domains that are now available. Play around with variations of your business name or key words describing your business until you find one you like and then buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hint: If you already own a domain name elsewhere and want to transfer it to Google you can follow the same process. You will see the opposing arrow icon to start the transfer process. Transferring a domain can take days to a week or more. In addition, you cannot transfer a domain name again without waiting 90 days. So if you recently registered a new domain name you will have to wait to transfer it. That is not a issue, you can still set everything up now and transfer it later. It will not result in any downtime for your website or email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once your registration is completed you can return to &lt;a href=&quot;https://domains.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Domains&lt;/a&gt; and manage your new domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/domain-manager.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Google Domain Manager&quot; title=&quot;Google Domain Manager&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup Auto Renew. This is very important. Also, make sure your credit card stays up to date. This will prevent your registration from expiring.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to Settings and make your information private. It is free with Google, others can cost up to $8 for this service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure your personal contact information is correct.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resist the urge to click on the Build website buttons. Google wants you to buy into Wix or other third party website builders they promote. Rarely do they look professional when done, even if they do, they will will not let you optimize your site they way your need to. Stay with me here. Don’t do it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave everything else alone for now. We will connect your new website to this domain name later using DNS. If you choose another registrar that is OK too. The basic steps to connect to your new website will be same. Google is a great choice, but not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to learn more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/2016/11/12/Choose-the-Best-Hosting-Service.html&quot;&gt;hosting services&lt;/a&gt;. Or, go right to setting up an &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/2016/11/12/Static-Website-Hosting.html&quot;&gt;Amazon S3&lt;/a&gt; service to host your static website.&lt;/p&gt;

This article will describe how they work, how to choose one, and how to register one for your website and email.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Quick Start to Building a Website</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2016/10/01/Quick-Start.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Quick Start to Building a Website" /><published>2016-10-01T13:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-01T13:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2016/10/01/Quick-Start</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2016/10/01/Quick-Start.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/website-design.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Starting a Small Business Website&quot; title=&quot;Starting A Small Business Website&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with my goal of Helping Small Businesses Navigate the Internet this &lt;strong&gt;quick start to building a static website&lt;/strong&gt; will list the steps required to get your small business online. There are many ways of doing this, but I want to show how you can do it yourself at a low cost while still preserving the professional appearance and functionality your business needs to stand out from the competition as well as rank well with the search engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this article says it is a quick start, this not a &lt;em&gt;20 minute - click a few buttons&lt;/em&gt; instant online website promo that you may have seen on TV. Those do not provide the professional results you want. Be prepared to spend some time putting this together, however, you can build a professional website for under $30 and maintain it for under $5 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As risky as that may be, I am going to make several assumptions about you, the small business owner, as we go forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You only need a simple website to showcase the services you provide.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have average computer skills, or have someone in your family or business who does.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You do not have thousands of dollars to pay a web developer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we are done getting the basic website and email set up, I will post articles where you can learn how to add more functionality to your website. Even if you do not end up doing the work yourself, these articles will give you a better understanding of the basics so when your developer makes recommendations you will understand the level of work and associated costs that go with it. If you do hire a developer, please heed my advice about &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/2016/11/11/Whats-in-a-Domain-Name.html&quot;&gt;domain names&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-you-need-to-start&quot;&gt;What You Need to Start&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A computer connected to the Internet. The bigger the screen the better. I prefer Mac, but Windows will do.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good text editor. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sublimetext.com&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; but there are many great free ones out there. The important part is that it has syntax highlighting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A secure file transfer (SFTP) browser. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberduck.io&quot;&gt;Cyberduck&lt;/a&gt; is awesome and free.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patience - this will take awhile but you will save thousands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tip: Setup a free &lt;a href=&quot;https://accounts.google.com/SignUp&quot;&gt;Google account&lt;/a&gt; for your business. You do not have to setup Gmail to have a Google account. You will be using several of their services and you should keep them separate from your personal stuff. Also, get a good password manager. This will save you time and frustration. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://1password.com&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;steps-to-creating-your-small-business-online&quot;&gt;Steps to Creating your Small Business Online&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Register your &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/2016/11/11/Whats-in-a-Domain-Name.html&quot;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; - This is your address on the Internet, for example &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lampapps.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sign up for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/2016/11/12/Choose-the-Best-Hosting-Service.html&quot;&gt;hosting&lt;/a&gt; service - This is a system of web services that serves your website out to the Internet. I use Amazon S3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create your website content - This is all the layout and text that people see when they visit your website. This will be the most time consuming part.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload you content to your hosting service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Point your domain name to your hosted website content - You will use a Domain Name Service (DNS) to do this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email - Not to be overlooked, you need a professional email address. Please don’t use AOL for your business email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of each are covered in the separate articles, but in general, your uploaded content includes all the formatting, images, and words your customers will see. All this is uploaded to your account at a hosting company of your choice. When a customer types your domain name into a browser, or more likely, finds your business using a search engine like Google, they are directed to your account at the hosting company where they will see your content displayed on their computer or mobile device. This all happens in a fraction of a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like your website, email is also dependent on your domain name, but is handled very differently. I will show you how to setup an email account and provide tips on using it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend you start with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/2016/11/11/Whats-in-a-Domain-Name.html&quot;&gt;Whats in a Domain Name&lt;/a&gt; article, then follow the steps listed above. But it’s your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
