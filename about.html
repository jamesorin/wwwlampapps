        ampApps was a small web development company located in Charleston, SC. A one man shop that provided other small businesses with development, hosting, email, and local SEO services at a fair price for many years. I prided myself on customer service.

      <p style="font-size: larger;">I know the challenges for a small business to navigate the complexities of establishing and maintaining a professional web presence. This often leads to small start ups to do it themselves, or pay to have it done by someone else.</p>

        My goal is to share what I have learned helping others with their websites, email, and local SEO, often using high quality free or low cost services that I have used in my business. I often leveraged open source products in my business, passing along savings to my clients.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: larger;">Not everything is free and quality can cost money. Somethings can not be jeopardized especially when it comes to financial transactions on the Internet. This website extends what I have learned to you in hopes that you benefit from it.</p>
